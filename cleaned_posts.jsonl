This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments: Isolation ‚Äì Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects. Reproducibility ‚Äì A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.
